<h1>Stock Price And News Alert</h1>

This Python script is designed to provide real-time alerts on stock price changes for a specified stock and deliver news articles related to a particular company. The script leverages various APIs, including Alpha Vantage for stock price data and News API for news articles, and sends notifications via Twilio.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 36.
